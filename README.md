# 🛡️ TrustLens
> Detect manipulation before the user clicks pay.

TrustLens is a browser-based safety assistant that helps users identify online manipulation, dark patterns, phishing attempts, scam websites, suspicious messages, and risky payment requests before they result in financial loss or privacy compromise.

Unlike traditional security tools that focus primarily on malware and malicious URLs, TrustLens focuses on the **human manipulation layer** of cybercrime. It detects deceptive design techniques, fraudulent content, and scam indicators in real time and explains risks in clear, understandable language.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Online scams rarely begin with malicious code. Most begin with manipulation.
Websites and messages often create:

* False urgency
* Fake scarcity
* Emotional pressure
* Hidden costs
* Deceptive subscription flows
* Fake banking alerts
* Payment scams
* Credential theft attempts

TrustLens identifies these signals and warns users before they make risky decisions.
The platform combines:

* Dark Pattern Detection
* Scam Website Analysis
* Suspicious Message Classification
* Payment Risk Assessment
* Explainable AI-based Risk Alerts

into a single browser extension.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Modern scams exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.
Common examples include:

* Fake countdown timers
* "Only 2 left" scarcity tactics
* Confirmshaming
* Hidden cancellation options
* Fake KYC verification pages
* Courier and electricity bill scams
* Digital arrest scams
* UPI collect-request fraud
* Job scams requiring registration fees

Most existing tools focus on malware and malicious links, leaving users vulnerable to manipulation techniques that influence decision-making.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
TrustLens is a Chrome Extension that evaluates web pages and messages in real time and provides users with clear, actionable explanations.
